- always use `.` at the end of each statement, otherwise it will throw an error.
- save the text file into `.lp` file format.
- to run, go to the folder and open cmd or terminal where the clingo.exe exists. 
- then type and enter `clingo 0 code1.lp`
- for the variable stuff at the end we also include the obj(X) Example: `q(X) :- p(X), r(X), not s(X),obj(X).`
